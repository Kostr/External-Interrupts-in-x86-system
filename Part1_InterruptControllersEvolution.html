	<h3>Introduction</h3>
	<p>We all know what interrupt is. For those who don't, here is a quote from Wikipedia:<p/>

	<blockquote>In system programming, an interrupt is a signal to the processor emitted by hardware or software indicating an event that needs immediate attention. An interrupt alerts the processor to a high-priority condition requiring the interruption of the current code the processor is executing. The processor responds by suspending its current activities, saving its state, and executing a function called an interrupt handler (or an interrupt service routine, ISR) to deal with the event. This interruption is temporary, and, after the interrupt handler finishes, the processor resumes normal activities.

	There are two types of interrupts: hardware interrupts and software interrupts (softirqs):

	<ul>
		<li>Hardware interrupts are used by devices to communicate that they require attention from the operating system. Internally, hardware interrupts are implemented using electronic alerting signals that are sent to the processor from an external device, which is either a part of the computer itself, such as a disk controller, or an external peripheral. For example, pressing a key on the keyboard or moving the mouse triggers hardware interrupts that cause the processor to read the keystroke or mouse position. The act of initiating a hardware interrupt is referred to as an interrupt request (IRQ).</li>
		<li>A software interrupt is caused either by an exceptional condition in the processor itself, or a special instruction in the instruction set which causes an interrupt when it is executed. The former is often called a trap or exception and is used for errors or events occurring during program execution that are exceptional enough that they cannot be handled within the program itself. For example, a divide-by-zero exception will be thrown if the processor's arithmetic logic unit is commanded to divide a number by zero as this instruction is an error and impossible. </li>
	</ul></blockquote>

	<p>This article is about hardware/external interrupts IRQ.<p/>

	<p>What is the purpose of interrupts? For example, we want to make some action with an incoming packet from the network card, as soon as the packet arrives. If you don't want to continuously ask the network card "Have my packet arrived?" and waste your processor time, you can make use of external hardware interrupt IRQ. Interrupt line from a device should be connected to INTR line of CPU, and after each packet receive, the network card will make a signal over this line. CPU will sense this signal, and know that network card has information for it. Only after that CPU will read the incoming packet.<p/>

	<p>But what should we do if there are a lot of external devices? Cause there are can't be enough pins on CPU for all of them.<p/>

	<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vg/3q/3v/vg3q3v7kx8vjttp43xo99o8pccs.png" />

	<p>To solve this problem special chip was invented - an interrupt controller.<p/>

	<h3>PIC</h3>
	(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmable_interrupt_controller">wiki</a>/<a href="https://wiki.osdev.org/8259_PIC">osdev</a>) 

	<p>The first interrupt controller chip was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_8259">Intel 8259 PIC</a>. 8 input lines (IRQ0-7) and 1 output line which connects interrupt controller with INTR line of CPU. When there is an interrupt from one of the devices on its input lines, 8259 will make a signal over INTR line. After that CPU will know that some device require its immediate attention, and processor will ask PIC which of 8 input lines (IRQx) was a source of this interrupt. There is some overhead for this polling, but now we have 8 interrupt lines instead of 1.<p/>

	<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/le/yf/6e/leyf6enogyzp6flpijo2d0x1w9g.png" />

	<p>Soon 8 lines weren't enough. To increase total interrupt line number two controllers 8259 (master and slave) were connected in a cascade (Dual PIC).<p/>

	<p>IRQs from 0 to 7 are processed with the first Intel 8259 PIC (master), and IRQs from 8 to 15 are processed with the second Intel 8259 PIC (slave). Only master is connected to CPU and can signal about the incoming interrupt. If there is an interrupt on lines 8-15, the second PIC (slave) will signal about it to master on the line IRQ2, and after that master will make a signal to CPU. This cascaded interrupt takes 1 from 16 lines, but makes total of 15 interrupts for all external devices.<p/>

	<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xj/yn/dh/xjyndhabujjwz0alrbx831zfzt8.png" />

	<p>This scheme was approved by a community and when now someone talks about PIC (Programm Interrupt Controller) they mean this Dual PIC system. After some time controllers 8259 have gotten some improvements and got a new name 8259A. And this scheme was included in chipset. At a time when the main bus for external devices connection was ISA bus, this system was enough. It was only necessary to that differenet devices did not connect to the same IRQ line, as this produces conflicts cause ISA interrupts aren't shareable.<p/>

	<p>Usually a device interrupt mapping was pretty much standard:<p/>

	<p>Example (from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrupt_request_(PC_architecture)">here</a>):<p/>
	IRQ 0 — system timer<br/>
	IRQ 1 — keyboard controller<br/>
	IRQ 2 — cascade (interrupt from slave controller)<br/>
	IRQ 3 — serial port COM2<br/>
	IRQ 4 — serial port COM1<br/>
	IRQ 5 — parallel port 2 and 3 or sound card<br/>
	IRQ 6 — floppy controller<br/>
	IRQ 7 — parallel port 1<br/>
	IRQ 8 — RTC timer<br/>
	IRQ 9 — ACPI<br/>
	IRQ 10 — open/SCSI/NIC<br/>
	IRQ 11 — open/SCSI/NIC<br/>
	IRQ 12 — mouse controller<br/>
	IRQ 13 — math co-processor<br/>
	IRQ 14 — ATA channel 1<br/>
	IRQ 15 — ATA channel 2<br/>

	<p>The configuration and work with 8259 chips is carried out with I/O ports:<p/>

	<p>Full documentation of the 8259A can be found <a href="https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2005/readings/hardware/8259A.pdf">here</a><p/>

	<p>The PCI bus has replaced the ISA bus. And the number of devices amount clearly began to 
	exceed the number 15. Plus instead of the static ISA bus in the PCI bus devices can be added to system dynamically. But luckily, in the PCI bus interrupts can be shared (it means that it is possible to connect many devices to one interrupt line IRQ). In the end, to solve the problem of lack of interrupt lines, it was decided to group interrupts from all of PCI devices to PIRQ lines (Programmable Interrupt Request).<p/>

	<p>For example we have 4 free interrupt lines on the PIC controller and 20 PCI devices. We can combine interrupts by 5 devices at one PIRQx line, and connect these PIRQx lines to the PIC controller. In this case if there is an interrupt on one of PIRQx lines, processor will have to ask all devices connected to this line about the interrupt, to know who is responsible for it, but in the end it solves the problem. The device that connects PCI interrupt lines to PIRQ lines is often called a PIR router.<p/>

	<p>In this method it is necessary to watch out that PIRQx lines don't connect to lines with ISA interrupts (cause this will produce conflicts) and PIRQx lines are balanced (the more devices we connect to one line, the more devices CPU will need to poll, when it will need to understand which device is responsible for the interrupt).<p/>

	<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/u_/jr/u9/u_jru9pemdeda2xvvbqihvgtp3y.png" />

	<p><b>Note</b>: on the image mapping PCI device -> PIR is pictured abstractedly, cause in the real case it is a little bit more complicated. In real life each PCI device have 4 interrupt lines (INTA, INTB, INTC, INTD). Also each PCI device can have up to 8 functions. And each function can have only one of these INTx interrupts. Which INTx line will be used by each function is determined by a chipset configuration.<p/>

	<p>By its nature functions are separate logical blocks. For example one PCI device can have an Smbus controller function, a SATA controller function, a LPC bridge function. From the point of an operating system (OS) each function is like a separate device with its own configuration space (PCI config).<p/>


	<p>Information about a PIC controller interrupt routing is sent to OS by BIOS with a help of the table $PIR and through registers 3Ch (INT_LN Interrupt Line (R/W)) and 3Dh (INT_PN Interrupt Pin (RO)) of the PCI configuration space for each function.<p/>

	<p>A specification for $PIR table recently was <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/archive/pciirq.mspx">on the Intel website</a>, but currently it is unavailable. Is is possible to understand the table's content from <a href="http://www.o3one.org/hwdocs/bios_doc/pci_bios_21.pdf">PCI BIOS Specification</a> [4.2.2. Get PCI Interrupt Routing Options] or read it <a href="http://ru.osdev.wikia.com/wiki/PCI_IRQ_Routing_Table_Specification">here</a> (last link is in Russian, but you can try to google for "PCI IRQ Routing Table Specification")<p/>

	<h3>APIC </h3>
	(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Programmable_Interrupt_Controller">wiki</a>, <a href="https://wiki.osdev.org/APIC">osdev</a>)

	<p>The last method was working until a multiprocessor system has arrived. It is because by its nature PIC can send interrupts only to the one CPU. And of course it is desired to load CPUs in the multiprocessor system in a balanced way. The solution to this problem was the new APIC interface (Advanced PIC).<p/>

	<p>For each processor, a special controller called LAPIC (Local APIC) is added. Also for routing interrupts from external devices controller <a href="https://wiki.osdev.org/IOAPIC">I/O APIC</a> is added. All these controllers are combined in a common bus with a name APIC (modern systems instead of this separate APIC bus make use of a standard system bus for this task).<p/>

	<p>When external interrupt arrives on the I/O APIC input, controller will send an interrupt message to LAPIC of one of the system CPUs. This way the I/O APIC controller help to ballance interrupt load between processors.<p/>

	<p>The first APIC chip was <a href="https://4donline.ihs.com/images/VipMasterIC/IC/INTL/INTLD047/INTLD047-2-1259.pdf?hkey=EF798316E3902B6ED9A73243A3159BB0">82489DX</a>, this was a separate chip with connected LAPIC and I/O APIC in itself. To make system with 2 processors it was needed 3 such chips (2 for LAPIC and 1 for I/O APIC). Later LAPIC functionality was directly included in processors, and an I/O APIC part was made to a separate 82093AA chip.<p/>

	<p>The I/O APIC <a href="https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2016/readings/ia32/ioapic.pdf">82093AA</a> had 24 inputs, and APIC architecture could support up to 16 CPUs. For compatibility with older systems interrupts 0~15 were left for old ISA interrupts. And interrupts from PCI devices start to route on IRQ lines 16-23. With this you can forget about conflicts between ISA and PCI interrupts. Also cause of increased number of free interrupt lines it is became possible to increase number of PIRQx lines.<p/>

	<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/mc/ra/hj/mcrahjn-owk9qrcmyiixcmhomcq.png" />

	<p>I/O APIC and LAPIC programming is made with a help of MMIO. LAPIC registers usually are placed on address 0xFEE00000, and I/O APIC registers on address 0xFEС00000. But it is possible to reconfigure all these addresses.<p/>

	<p>As in a PIC case, separate chips at first became a part of a chipset later. <p/>

	<p>Later APIC architecture get a modernization and its new variant get a name xAPIC (x - extended). With a full backward compatibility, the total number of possible CPUs in system was increased to 256.<p/>

	<p>The next step in architecture development has got a name <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/dam/doc/specification-update/64-architecture-x2apic-specification.pdf">x2APIC</a>. The number of possible CPUs in the system was increased to 2^32. Controllers can work in a backward compatibility mode to xAPIC, or they can work in a new x2APIC mode. In this new mode controller programming is made not through MMIO but through MSR registers (which is much faster). According to <a href="https://blahg.josefsipek.net/?tag=xAPIC">this link</a> for this mode IOMMU support is necessary.<p/>

	<p>It is worth to notice that it is possible to have many I/O APIC controllers in the system. For example, one for 24 interrupts in a southbridge and the other one for 32 interrupts in a northbridge. In the context of I/O APIC, interrupts usually titled as GSI (Global System Interrupt). So, the forementioned system has GSIs 0-55.<p/>

	<p>Does the CPU have an internal LAPIC and which APIC architecture exactly? It is possible to get answers to these questions by inspecting bit-flags from CPUID.
	To help OS to discover LAPIC and I/O APIC, BIOS should present information about them either through a MPtable (old method) or through an ACPI table (a MADT table in this case). Besides common information, both the MPtable and the ACPI (in this case a DSDT table) should contain info about the interrupt routing. This means information about which device uses which interrupt line (a $PIR table analogy).<p/>

	<p>You can read about the MPtable in the official <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121002210153/http://download.intel.com/design/archives/processors/pro/docs/24201606.pdf">specification</a>. Earlier the specification was on the Intel website, but currently it is only possible to find it in an archive version. The ACPI specification can be found on the UEFI website (current version is <a href="https://www.uefi.org/sites/default/files/resources/ACPI_6_2.pdf">6.2</a>). It is worth to notice that with ACPI it is possible to declare the interrupt routing for systems without APIC (instead of providing a separate $PIR table).<p/>

	 <h3>MSI </h3>
	(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_Signaled_Interrupts">wiki</a>)

	<p>The last variant with APIC was good, but not without downsides. All these interrupt lines from devices make the system very complicated and thus increase error probability. The PCI express bus came to replace the PCI bus, and PCI express simplifies all interrupt system completely. It doesn't have interrupt lines at all. For backward compatibility interrupt signals (INTx#) are emulated with a separate kind of messages. With PCI interrupt lines their a connection was made with physical wires connection. With PCI express interrupt lines a connection is logical and is made by PCI express bridges. But this support of legacy INTx interrupts only exist for a backward compatibility with the PCI bus. The PCI express introduces completely new method of interrupt delivery - MSI (Message Signaled Interrupts). In this method device signals about the interrupt simply by writing in a special place in MMIO region of CPUs LAPIC.<p/>

	<p>Earlier one PCI device (this means all its functions) could have only 4 interrupts, but now it is became possible to address up to 32 interrupts.<p/>

	<p>In a case of MSI there is no sharing for interrupt lines, every interrupt naturally corresponds to its device.<p/>

	<p>MSI interrupts also solve one more problem. For example let's imagine a situation where a device makes a memory-write transaction, and wants to signal about its completion through the interrupt. But a write transaction can be delayed on the bus in a process of its transmission (and the device couldn't know about it). In this case a signal about the interrupt will come to CPU first, so a processor will read yet not valid data. If MSI is used, information about MSI is transmitted in the same way as data messages, and it can't came earlier.<p/>

	<p>It is worth to notice that MSI interrupts can't work without LAPIC, but MSI's can replace I/O APIC (one more design simplicity).<p/>

	<p>After some time the MSI method was extended to MSI-X. Now every device can have up to 2048 interrupts. Also now it's possible to specify which CPU should process which interrupt. It can be very useful for highload devices like network cards for example.<p/>

	<p>There is no need in separate BIOS table for MSI support. But the device should indicate about its MSI support through one of the Capabilities in its PCI Config space. Also a device driver should include all necessary support for working with the MSI.<p/>

	<h3>Сonclusion</h3>
	<p>In this article we have studied information about interrupt controller evolution and have got a common theoretical knowledge about the interrupt delivery from external devices in x86 system.<p/>

	<p>In the next part we will go practice and see how to engage each of forementioned interrupt controllers in Linux.<p/>

	<p>In the third part we will look in a coreboot code and see, what settings are need to be done in chipset for a correct interrupt routing.<p/>
